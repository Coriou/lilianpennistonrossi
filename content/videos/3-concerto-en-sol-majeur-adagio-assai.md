This piece is the part of the concerto when the orchestra gives way to the piano solo. The regularity of the three-beat waltz tempo is surpassed and transformed by the intricate, frequently off-key and/or off-beat notes in either right or left hand. The solo ends when the orchestra takes up the theme again, with multiple variations.
