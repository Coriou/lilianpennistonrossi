Before Bach came on the scene, the only authorized music was church-modal-music, with an extremely limited number of keys. Bach promoted the well-tempered clavier, making possible 48 major and minor keys, causing the shift from musical uniformity to harmonics. This, in turn, gave greater colour and tone to music, enhancing it to a hitherto unthinkable level of enjoyment. This adagio, as well as the prelude N° 2 later in the programme, is an illustration of his genius.
