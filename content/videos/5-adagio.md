This poignant adagio was found among the ruins of Dresden at the end of World War Two, by a musicologist who adapted it and who now owns the copyright. The original manuscript, for organ and strings, was by a 17th century Venetian composer. It’s a fitting piece to express the suffering caused by war to men of all countries.
