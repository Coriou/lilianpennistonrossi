Schumann was told by his future 19-year old wife Clara Wieck that « _he seemed like a child_ ». In fact she was and remained a sensitive, guileless artist, easily wounded and extremely unworldly. His Romantic spirit gave rise to some of the greatest piano music ever composed. Clara had to take her case for marrying him to court, after her father’s repeated refusal to give his consent. She won her case.
