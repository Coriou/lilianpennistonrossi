Composed in 1801, this sonata is a manifesto of the C sharp minor tone. Dramatic tension emerges from the lack of rupture hand-in-hand with the many alterations – changing a note from natural to sharp and vice versa -and adding double sharps and double flats. It is the first manifesto ever of slowness and Romantic introspection.
