Haendel is a German composer who spent the last 35 years of his life at the English Court in London, where the three Georgian Kings of the House of Hanover reigned from 1714 to 1887. He was the first composer to earn his living through music, as the King and Queen of England’s official conductor. The Sarabande is a stately dance, expressing here the Sovereigns’ majesty and glory.
