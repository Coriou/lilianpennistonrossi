A posthumus work illustrating one of Chopin’s innovations, namely of superposing binary and tertiary (two-beat and three-beat) rhythms, one in the left hand, the other in the right hand, an extremely difficulttechnique requiring a perfect independence of each hand from the other. Combined with a swift tempo, sixteen-note bar and rapidly, constantly changing accidentals, it isn’t a piece for the faint-hearted.
